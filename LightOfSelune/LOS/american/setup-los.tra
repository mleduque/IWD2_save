Bonefang is a dagger of assassination. The blade is made from the bone of some unknown creature and it secretes an exceptionally nasty poison that not only slowly drains the life from its victims, it also dulls their body's response, making them susceptible to additional attacks.  

It is strange that such a lethal dagger can be wielded by even a good-hearted rogue, for Bonefang stinks of evil.  Some speculate that this is a ruse by Talona, the Lady of Poison herself, or perhaps some of her upper level clergy to lure non-evil rogues into her fold with the seductive power of Bonefang's wicked venom.  None know for certain.  All that is certain is that in the hands of a trained assassin, Bonefang is a weapon to be reckoned with.

Kheros the Red wore this blood-red suit of full plate through many of the years that he fought for the church of Tempus.  He was born as the son of humble farmers near Calaunt.  When he was a young man, he set off for the city to hire himself out as a mercenary.  After a number of successful endeavors, Kheros became a short-term member of many adventuring companies.  Along the way, despite his many victories, Kheros became disgusted and terrified by the sight of blood.

His fear eventually spiraled out of control, consuming him with madness.  Priests of Tempus found the huge warrior and took him into safe-keeping.  The priests believed that they could cure Kheros of his fear.  Over several years, Kheros learned the ways of the Tempuran religion, eventually becoming a priest.  His final step in overcoming his fear was being submerged in a tub of blood until he almost drowned.  All the time he was held down, he never struggled, flinched or tried to escape.  In his later years, he had a suit of armor made to remind him of his past.

// Slayer
@300    = ~Slayer: +5 Keen Spear

A fallen paladin called Matthain "Blackwatch" used this weapon to kill one hundred and one knights of his former king.  Matthain's family, Chamberlain, had a long tradition of producing paladins of Tyr.  Matthain's father, Garlan, slew a powerful high priest of Bane who had been posing a threat to the kingdom.  The priest's evil magic brought him back from the dead.  This priest, called "The Chamberlain Haunt," cursed the Chamberlain family to only produce stillborn children until he had been appeased.  Matthain, as the heir to the family, took it upon himself to remove the curse.  The Chamberlain Haunt told Matthain that he must kill one hundred and one knights of the king.

Matthain began his grim task, slaughtering every knight he came across.  He brought the skull and shield of each warrior to the Chamberlain Haunt as proof of his deed.  The king dispatched bands of knights and heroes to kill Matthain, but he proved too difficult a foe.  Finally, after three years of murdering, Matthain had killed one hundred knights.  He told the Chamberlain Haunt that it was time to end the curse.  The Chamberlain Haunt corrected him, reminding the fallen paladin that he had to kill one hundred and one knights of the king.

Overcome with misery and regret, Matthain nodded and immediately threw himself on his own spear.  With Matthain and Garlan dead, and the letter of his requirements fulfilled, the curse was ended and the Chamberlain Haunt was called to Acheron by Bane, screaming all the way.

His enemies fell by the dozens when he fought with his trusty hammer in hand, both to protect him and to bring justice to the wicked.

However, Hratan's days came to an end not on the field of battle, but at an inn.  As he had done so often, Hratan savored his final victory in many tankards of his favorite ale.  But on this night, Hratan was so drunk, in spite of his stupendous dwarven endurance, that he didn't realize that his life was melting away due to a terrible poison slipped into his last tankard.  

On the next morn, when the innkeeper came to rouse Hratan, he found the mighty cleric dead, Stormbreaker gone, and a note left on the nightstand.

"The cries for vengeance have been answered.  The slayer of so many of my brethren has finally paid the price for their murders.  Stormbreaker's days of slaying brothers and sisters of the Storm are at an end.

Krandok the Bugbear was never a great thinker, even by bugbear standards.  However, when his big wooden club began to end up with shards of metal embedded in it, Krandok thought that they just might make his club hurt a little more in battle, so he left them as is.  Over time, his club began to collect more and more of these shards and Krandok also intentionally embedded some of his own.  The result is what Krandok has called his "Nasty Club".

@343    = ~Skirmisher~
@344    = ~Skirmisher: +4 Composite Shortbow

Atheria Tarathel, an elven ranger and devout worshiper of Mielikki, spent many years defending the great forests of the Dalelands, ranging from Hillsfar in the north to Tilverton to the south.  Atheria's preference for the shortbow over the longbow was more a matter of her short stature, than any inability to pull a strong bow.  Indeed, Atheria prefered the strong pull of a powerful composite shortbow over a weaker non-composite bow.

Many were the days that Atheria and Skirmisher fought many times times her number in the deepwood and the dales.  Atheria would take a few shots,  slay two or three foes, and then use her great speed to withdraw before any of her enemies could reach her, only to begin the stalking process once again.

Unfortunately, a day came when a group of Malarites, angered by Atheria's ardent defense of the forests and the great numbers of their hunters and priests she'd slain, arranged a rather large ambush for her.  What this force was composed of, none know.  All that is known is that Atheria Tarathel managed to slay all but a few of her ambushers before she fell herself, unable to escape from the overwhelming numbers.  Skirmisher itself was presumed to have been lost forever, as it had not been seen since.  Some believe that Mielikki herself may have snatched up Skirmisher after Atheria fell, rather than allow it to fall into Malarite hands.

Kanno saw a vision of a powerful crossbow with exceptional range and striking power for the warrior strong enough to pull back the bowstring.

This particular bow is unique due to a flaw during its creation that limits its range to only 80% of normal shortbow range.

The Great Archer's prowess with the bow is unmatched by any other power venerated in the Realms.  Solonor is concerned with the integrity of nature and the balance between exploitation and agriculture on one hand and fallow, wild terrains on the other... 

 ...He instructs the Fair Folk in the art of hiding in and moving through natural foliage so as not to be detected as well as the art of archery and hunting.  Solonor is primarily revered by elven and half-elven rangers, hunters, woodsmen, and fighters.  In particular, elven hunters appeal to him for better catches of game and elven warriors trapped in hostile territory call on him for aid.  In recent centuries a few humans, primarily hunters, have joined his faith as well.

This magical tome positively surges with good elven magic, although the exact nature of that magic is completely beyond your best efforts to determine through divination magics or ancient lore.

This unique breastplate is obviously of foreign design, created for the mysterious Kara-Turian samurai named Raven before she escaped to Faerun following the defeat of her clan by a thoroughly dishonorable overlord.

For years, Raven wandered the lands of Faerun, offering her services to any chivilric order that would accept her. Raven built up an outstanding reputation as a great warrior and trustworthy companion and was gladly accepted as an ally of nearly all chivilric orders across Faerun.  However, while in Calimport, Raven disappeared without a trace, never to be seen again.  Some wondered if she was a victim of an assassination at the hands of some group whom she'd defeated.  Others wondered if she merely decided to settle down and end her adventuring days.

While it's not exactly a a dwarves only weapon, the waraxe will not allow any evil or chaotic person to wield it, nor will it allow any non-warrior or battlecleric to use it either.

@421    = ~Hoarfrost~
@422    = ~Hoarfrost: +3 Katana

The history of this weapon is both long and very vague.  It was not made in Faerun, but in the distant land of Kara-Tur.  None know the true name of its last owner.  She is said to have only gone by name of Raven during her time travelling Faerun.  It is believed that Raven was some sort of Kara-Turan knight, called a "samurai" by most accounts, who was forced to flee her family's ancestral lands.  Most tales say that Raven fled rather than fight to prevent her enemy, apparantly some thoroughly dishonorable overlord, from gaining her family's most prized possession, Hoarfrost.  

When Raven arrived in Faerun, she offered her services to any chivilric order that would accept her blade.  In that time, she acted in nearly every way as a paladin without any divine patron or powers.  Raven built up an outstanding reputation as a great warrior and trustworthy companion and was gladly accepted as an ally of nearly all chivilric orders across Faerun.  However, while in Calimport, Raven disappeared without a trace, never to be seen again.  Some wondered if she was a victim of an assassination at the hands of some group whom she'd defeated.  Others wondered if she merely decided to settle down and end her adventuring days.

Raven's sword, Hoarfrost, is her family's honor sword and has been enchanted with the spirits of many of her ancestors who were also honored samurai.  With Hoarfrost in her hands, it was said that Raven never knew true defeat nor dishonor during her days in Faerun, at least until she disappeared.

Hoarfrost is a Kara-turan bastard sword, called a "katana".  While capable of being used by a truly skilled Kara-turan warrior one-handed, many prefer to use it two handed, taking advantage of its long handle to provide greater balance and power in combat.  However, for some reason, perhaps the spirits of the sword, anyone wielding Hoarfrost cannot help but wield it two-handed.  Furthermore, it is said that the spirits of the sword only speak with the raging power of winter from which Hoarfrost takes its name whenever the blade strikes.

For a gaijin, or foreigner, to own such a blade is a rare occurrence. Either the gaijin is a greatly honored friend of an important minister, or  the gaijin has murdered a samurai.

And these warriors used poisoned arrows that caused further harm to their enemies.  He even saw or heard a name in this dream, although it was hard to comprehend and even harder to remember.  Using his considerable skill as a bowyer, Kanno turned this vision into a powerful weapon.

After the defeat of the Yuan-ti forces in the depths of the northern stronghold of Dragon's Eye and the loss of the historical relic, the Messenger of Sseth longbow, yuan-ti bowyers decided to craft a new longbow to honor the memory of their lost warriors.  The result was "Avenger", so named in the hope that future yuan-ti archers would use it to avenge themselves upon the slayers of so many of Sseth's chosen people and of their beloved leader, the marilith Yxunomei.

Avenger is much heavier than most normal longbows, due to the sturdier construction required for such a powerful bow.  Only the strongest archers can pull back its bowstring to wield it properly.

Though coated in metal, its blade has been reinforced with human bones.  Furthermore its hilt, and accompanying scabbard, have been stylishly made from tanned human flesh and skin.

Little is known about the origins of this sword, but Mulhorandi aristocrats have passed its rumor from generation to generation.  According to legend, whenever a human Mulhorandi woman gave birth to a girl after having been forced into slavery, she would, on the night of the first full moon, pray to the ancient pharaoh Tyrish for guidance.  Hearing her prayers, Tyrish would send "floating down from the heavens" this weapon, originally no larger than a stiletto, and the woman would use it to severely disfigure her child.  Once the deed was done, the weapon would enlarge slightly before floating away as gracefully as it had arrived.  These "marked" children, now deemed undesirable by their male overseers, would be allowed to purchase their freedom, thus sparing them the horrors of slavery.  The scars inflicted upon these children - those physical in nature at least - would eventually heal over time.

The Kegsplitter of Shaengarne Ford was most likely sold to the Gallaway Trade Depot in exchange for foodstuffs and supplies to last Shaengarne Ford through the season.

// NM Cera Sumat as a Greatsword
@622    = ~The holy avenger is the paladin's ultimate weapon against the forces of evil.  There are few creatures on the Lower Planes that would not hesitate to confront a holy warrior wielding such a weapon... and this one, perhaps more so than others.  Once, it was nothing more than a simple iron sword, but through the courage and faith of one man, it became something more.

The blade of this holy avenger glows with a soft golden light.  Inscribed upon the hilt in flowing gold letters is "Cera Sumat," which translates into "Six, now Silenced."  Cera Sumat earned its name through the labors of elderly duke Kholsa Ehld, a man cresting nearly eighty years of age, who vowed to complete a task that the greatest warriors of three kingdoms feared to do... all because of the weeping of a child. 

The times in which Old Duke Ehld lived were ones of great upheaval, and the servitors of Bane were strong, crushing all that stood in their way.  Entire kingdoms feared their wrath, and to speak out against them meant death, so many remained silent and turned their eyes from the evils of Bane and his servants. 

During these dark times, the most terrible of Bane's minions were six who called themselves the Lost Followers.  Their souls were storms of avarice and hate, and mighty were the powers at their command.  They reveled in strife and tyranny... and for all the blood they shed, it was never enough.  

Together, the Lost Followers brought about the downfall of the Silver Court, slaying its king upon his throne and renaming his once-beautiful nation the Barbed Kingdom.  After animating his decapitated corpse and having it march through the streets slaying anyone it could find, they brought a rain of fire down upon the city and the lands around, leaving it a barren wasteland.  It is said that they dined in the capital's great hall that night as the land burned, and they raised their wine glasses as the screams of the dying reached their peak. 

There was only one survivor.  In their last act of malice, the Lost Followers left the king's only daughter, barely five years old, alive to reign as "Queen" over the burned kingdom.  They called her the Weeping Queen and cast wards about her so that she might never leave the empty capital, and then left her to starve.  Their appetite momentarily slaked, the Lost Followers parted ways and went upon their separate roads of damnation, sowing strife in the Bane's Name.

Old Duke Ehld was the first one to cross the wards of the Barbed Kingdom and seek out the Weeping Queen upon her father's throne.  When he found the small girl, he approached, kneeled before her, and told her he had come to pledge his life in her service.  In stiff, formal words, he said he had brought food and water and apologized for his lateness, but his bones were old and it had taken him some time to reach this place.  The near-starving child stared at him as he pledged his worn blade and his honor to seeing that the ones who had done this terrible crime answered for their actions, if his Queen wished it.  After a long, stunned silence, the Weeping Queen found the words to thank him.

From the moment Ehld left the throne room in search of the Lost Followers, the weeping of the queen ended, and she never wept again. 

Over six years, Ehld traveled the lands of Faerun and across the planes themselves, seeking the Six, and asking them to answer for their crimes.  Each scoffed at the old man and his worn-looking blade, only to find him a dangerous opponent... and in the end, the victor.  He recorded the events of their death upon a stone set into the pommel of his blade, and there was even regret in his writings that he had not been able to enlighten the Lost Followers to turn from their path before it came to its end.

When the last of the Six had answered for their crimes upon the edge of the Cera Sumat blade, Ehld returned to the Weeping Queen and laid the blade at her feet.  Where once it had been a tarnished blade, it shone as brightly as the sun, and the stone in the pommel was covered with the writing of his journeys.  He detached the stone, and set into a chain, and he gave the Weeping Queen.  Ehld told her to keep the chain to wear as a reminder of the many evils of the world and that they are never far from one's heart... but if one's heart is true and one's path is righteous, one may triumph against any number of evils.  

Duke Ehld outlived his queen, living to the age of 107, at which point Ehld took his Cera Sumat and left the Barbed Kingdom... and is said to have traveled north.  In time, the Barbed Kingdom rose to its former glory and its name was changed, and with it, the fate of Cera Sumat and the Medallion of the Lost Followers was forgotten... until your arrival in Kuldahar and the medallion and the Holy Avenger were united once again to meet the Lost Followers in battle one final time.  

But the story of Ehld and Cera Sumat was a story of another time, and of the adventures of another hero.  This is now your time, and your epic.  If your band counts a paladin among its number, then this ancient blade is yours to wield against the forces of evil...  

And perhaps, if your heart is true, save a land from destruction once again.

// HOF Cera Sumat as a Greatsword
@623    = ~The holy avenger is the paladin's ultimate weapon against the forces of evil.  There are few creatures on the Lower Planes that would not hesitate to confront a holy warrior wielding such a weapon... and this one, perhaps more so than others.  Once, it was nothing more than a simple iron sword, but through the courage and faith of one man, it became something more.

The blade of this holy avenger glows with a soft golden light.  Inscribed upon the hilt in flowing gold letters is "Cera Sumat," which translates into "Six, now Silenced."  Cera Sumat earned its name through the labors of elderly duke Kholsa Ehld, a man cresting nearly eighty years of age, who vowed to complete a task that the greatest warriors of three kingdoms feared to do... all because of the weeping of a child. 

The times in which Old Duke Ehld lived were ones of great upheaval, and the servitors of Bane were strong, crushing all that stood in their way.  Entire kingdoms feared their wrath, and to speak out against them meant death, so many remained silent and turned their eyes from the evils of Bane and his servants. 

During these dark times, the most terrible of Bane's minions were six who called themselves the Lost Followers.  Their souls were storms of avarice and hate, and mighty were the powers at their command.  They reveled in strife and tyranny... and for all the blood they shed, it was never enough. 

Together, the Lost Followers brought about the downfall of the Silver Court, slaying its king upon his throne and renaming his once-beautiful nation the Barbed Kingdom.  After animating his decapitated corpse and having it march through the streets slaying anyone it could find, they brought a rain of fire down upon the city and the lands around, leaving it a barren wasteland.  It is said that they dined in the capital's great hall that night as the land burned, and they raised their wine glasses as the screams of the dying reached their peak. 

There was only one survivor.  In their last act of malice, the Lost Followers left the king's only daughter, barely five years old, alive to reign as "Queen" over the burned kingdom.  They called her the Weeping Queen and cast wards about her so that she might never leave the empty capital, and then left her to starve.  Their appetite momentarily slaked, the Lost Followers parted ways and went upon their separate roads of damnation, sowing strife in the Bane's Name.

Old Duke Ehld was the first one to cross the wards of the Barbed Kingdom and seek out the Weeping Queen upon her father's throne.  When he found the small girl, he approached, kneeled before her, and told her he had come to pledge his life in her service.  In stiff, formal words, he said he had brought food and water and apologized for his lateness, but his bones were old and it had taken him some time to reach this place.  The near-starving child stared at him as he pledged his worn blade and his honor to seeing that the ones who had done this terrible crime answered for their actions, if his Queen wished it.  After a long, stunned silence, the Weeping Queen found the words to thank him.

From the moment Ehld left the throne room in search of the Lost Followers, the weeping of the queen ended, and she never wept again. 

Over six years, Ehld traveled the lands of Faerun and across the planes themselves, seeking the Six, and asking them to answer for their crimes.  Each scoffed at the old man and his worn-looking blade, only to find him a dangerous opponent... and in the end, the victor.  He recorded the events of their death upon a stone set into the pommel of his blade, and there was even regret in his writings that he had not been able to enlighten the Lost Followers to turn from their path before it came to its end.

When the last of the Six had answered for their crimes upon the edge of the Cera Sumat blade, Ehld returned to the Weeping Queen and laid the blade at her feet.

// Belib's Everlasting Torch
@628    = ~Belib's Everlasting Torch: +1 Light Mace

Belib the Wary was arguably the best-equipped adventurer the realms had ever known - or would have been, had he ever actually left his home on one.  Just one item from his astounding list of enchanted dungeoneering equipment is his Everlasting Torch.  A magical lantern fashioned in the shape of an elaborate wooden torch, the item burns with a bright orange flame that cannot be extinguished - whether dunked in water, buried under several feet of rock, or smashed over the head of a soggy marsh-troll, Belib's Everlasting Torch simply will not be put out.

When Belib finally finished the last of his items, he crammed them all into a giant pack - enchanted to hold far more than Belib could normally carry himself, of course - and heaved it onto his shoulders, prepared for the adventure of a lifetime.  As Belib crossed the threshold of his dwelling he tripped... and the tiny gnome was instantly crushed beneath his enormous backpack.  The bag burst open, its contents scattering across the Waterdeep street where Belib had lived and rapidly vanishing into the hands of various good-for-nothing passersby.

Belib's corpse was eventually taken to a temple and raised by a kind-hearted priestess, but by then the last of Belib's enchanted items... and most of the contents of his home... were long gone.  Grateful but understandably upset, Belib fashioned a number of unique magical items for the priestess before returning to his family and homeland, forever vanishing from the surface world.

It is said that once, during a very horrendous battle with an enemy tribe, Stogar Bearclaw actually grew stronger in the middle of combat.  With his newfound strength, he managed to literally blast through his opponents without so much as getting a scratch on his body. When all was said and done, two hundred men lay dead at Stogar's mighty feet.  Stogar looked at his accomplishment and burst out in praise of Uthgar and his Blue Bear Spirit. Since then, Stogar always referred to his armor as Uthgar's Blessing and wore it daily until the moment of his passing.

It was Stogar's final wish that Uthgar's Blessing be passed on to another worthy warrior.  For generations the armor passed from warrior to warrior, granting extra strength to those who wore it.

One of the greatest skills a scout can have is the ability to sneak about undetected.  For many years a scout will hone their craft in the arts of hiding in shadows and moving silently, just so they may attain one of the most valuable resources in the realm - information. 

While a skilled scout may be able to slink undetected around a camp of regular soldiers and bandits with ease, the same cannot be said if the camp the scout is observing is protected by detection magics.  It is because of this very reason that the armor known as Interloper was created.

Many generations ago, skilled wood elf craftsman perfected a technique that was able to combine powerful non-detection magic into leather armor. Using this armor, wood elf scouts could infiltrate even the most well protected campsites without fear of being discovered by any magical means. Unfortunately, one of the scouts grew careless and was captured as he was spying on a drow raiding party. After days of torturing their prisoner, the drow were able to learn how the scouts were able to infiltrate their camps and even the location of the village at which these special armors were being made. Needless to say, every man, woman and child in that village was ruthlessly slaughtered...except one. This particular Interloper armor managed to survive only because the individual who wore it was away from the wood elf community the day the drow attacked.

In order to overcome the overwhelming powers of a necromancer, Mizelle Krillor, a wild elf ranger who resided in the outlining wilderness of Kuldahar, along with the help of an unknown witch doctor, created the studded leather armor known as Zuvembie.

Cut from the enchanted flesh of a zombie, studded with silver and blessed by the witch doctor, Mizelle donned the unusual armor and immediately felt increased magical resistance.  Unfortunately, one of the side effects of Mizelle's new armor was a zombie curse that made her very socially unappealing.  However, she was so desperate to destroy the necromancer, she did not care.  With the ability to resist the necromancer's death spells, she cut him down with the ferocity of a demon.  Soon afterwards, she went to a cleric of Sune and had the cursed armor removed, never to be used again by the wild elf ranger.

It is often said that a person does not choose a profession, the profession chooses the person.  So was the case with Nasty Phil, the local corpse cleaner for the Ten Towns many years ago.  Nasty Phil, you see, was no undertaker - no, it was his responsibility, after a party of adventurers dispatched with a monster (or monsters) that was terrorizing a local community, to clean up the mess that was left over.  

The truly 'nasty' thing about Phil and the reason he got his nickname was that he relished his job.  He specially crafted this armor from the hides of different creatures so that he could delve even deeper into the more gruesome clean-up jobs.  In fact, it was not unusual for Nasty Phil to not clean himself after one of his jobs and prance around town covered in stinking, rotting flesh.  Bits and pieces of unidentified particles could be seen dangling off Nasty Phil's leather, prompting the locals to name his leather armor, Dirty Bits.

Over time, his leather armor developed immunities to certain things just from absorbing the years of monster mess that was never washed off.  Even though Dirty Bits has been cleaned from time to time, it still has bits of unidentified 'stuff' that seem to have fused itself to the armor, helping it to retain its dirty name.

@638    = ~Milton Sixtoes' Armor of Absolute Self: +3 Studded Leather Armor

Absolute Self started out as very ordinary studded leather armor worn by an even more ordinary thief named Milton Sixtoes (so named since he had six toes on his left foot).  Milton belonged to a local thieves guild in the mining city of Mirabar, and thus was tasked with petty thievery of coin purses and the occasional gem.  

All was well enough by Milton's ordinary standards, until one day when a thief of notable magical prowess transferred to Milton's guild.  The guild master assigned this new thief to be Milton's partner in crime, aiding him in his petty, but profitable dirty deeds.  Little did Milton know that his new partner was not satisfied with petty thievery.  In fact, it was his partner's higher ambition that almost got Milton in trouble with the local authorities.  During thieving assignments with his new partner, Milton began to perform very risky acts of larceny, and not through his own will.  It was as if someone else had control of Milton's body and used him to carry out the acts.  Luckily for Milton, he was able to perform the higher risk activities, but he knew that one day his luck would run out.

So, one day when Milton was feeling more proactive than usual, he took the day off from thieving and ventured to a Dwarven armorsmith who resided in one of the upper Mirabar mining tunnels.  There, with his extra earnings from unwillingly performing his more dangerous thieving, he commissioned the dwarf to upgrade his studded leather and give it the power to ward off other's charms.  The dwarf complied and ended up upgrading Milton's ordinary studded leather into fine, extra tough studded leather that made the wearer immune to the spell Charm Person.

Not long after Milton began wearing the armor, he discovered his new partner was the one who cast the spell Charm Person on him and made him take all the extra risks.  The last time his partner tried to charm Milton, he (Milton) played along as if he were charmed, snuck up behind his partner, and slit his throat with an ordinary, poisoned dagger.  From then on, Milton was very pleased to go back to ordinary, petty thievery, though no more partners were ever assigned to Milton Sixtoes.

There is great mystery surrounding this leather armor. No one knows how or where it came into existence.  What is known is that the leather was cut from the hide of an abishai, although it is impossible to tell what color abishai since the armor is colored a deep black.  In addition, it has an unusual, very light, vinegary smell.

Those that have worn the Abishai Hide were bestowed with a slight invulnerability to non-magical weapons.

@644    = ~Mercenary's Lot: +3 Chain Mail

The mercenary's lot has been a difficult one in the lands of Icewind Dale, for there is little to occupy one's fighting skills in the far north... at least until recently.  This armor was worn by a mercenary company called the Silver Band who was driven from the north after a heated debate at the Ten-Towns council (a debate that barred further mercenary service from most of the Ten-Towns for a period not exceeding three seasons).   According to the debate, the mercenaries were not seen as effective combatants, and certainly not worth the gold they were paid for their meager weapon skills.

In order to pay for their passage back south, the Silver Band was forced to sell several suits of their armor in order to transport their mounts and siege engines, and the Band swore they would never return to the North, even if the region perished under an avalanche of goblins and other freakish monsters. Apparently, their ability to predict the future was not listed in their company annals.

This armor is valued in the far north due to its ability to protect the wielder from the elements as well as being light enough to allow for greater freedom of movement.

This armor was worn by the commander of a mercenary company called the Silver Band who was driven from the Ten-Towns after a fierce debate on the merits of their weapon skills (and the amount of gold that would change hands in order to see these weapon skills in combat).  The commander apparently was killed in a drunken brawl by a warrior with a bizarre title before the rest of his band fled south, and this armor was taken by the local authorities in Bryn Shander.  It was since released and has passed through the hands of several merchants in the far north.

This armor is valued in the far north due to its ability to protect the wielder from the elements as well as being light enough to allow for greater freedom of movement.  Furthermore, the wearer of this armor never tires or becomes exhausted, and he can dispel exhaustion from his entire party once per day.

Kyndor Icehammer was a mighty Dwarven warrior who loved the cold of the Dales. Not only did Kyndor call Icewind Dale his home, but he also had a special connection to the Dales - it was a part of him - not just a part of his body, but of his very soul.

Kyndor was also a remarkable armor and weaponsmith.  Everything he forged had some kind of connection to Icewind Dale.  In fact, his very armor, forged by his own hands, seemed to have its own life, and that life was very protective of Kyndor.  Often times, during battle, his armor seemed to harness the elements of the Dales and retaliate against Kyndor's attackers.

Over time, Kyndor's armor attained the nickname of Glacial Resislience, due to the fact that all who wore the armor seemed as impenetrable as a glacier and just as deadly cold.

@648    = ~Sanctity of Being: +3 Splint Mail

Maya Selvinis was a solitary half-elf ranger who lived on the outskirts of Neverwinter.  Feeling different and un-whole due to her breeding, she rarely had any interaction with other people except when she was summoned to aid in a crisis.  Although she did not care for the company of others, she was more than eager to aid those in peril.  However, after helping others, she would quickly return to her solitary ways, despite the general tolerance exhibited by the locals in Neverwinter.

One special event that called for her ranger skills came and changed her life forever.  An elderly female cleric of Eilistraee came to Maya and asked her aid in tracking down and destroying a demon that was tormenting her flock.  Maya eagerly accepted the quest, put on her splint mail armor, secured her sword, and followed the cleric through the woods.  After a day's travel, the cleric stopped at a small clearing between four towering trees.  In the middle of the clearing was a small pond of water no wider than a yard.  The cleric turned to Maya and said that the demon could be seen in the pond.  Doubting, Maya approached the pond and peered in.  The only thing Maya saw was her own reflection, and she stated that fact rather tersely to the cleric.  The cleric smirked a bit and replied by saying that the demon was her reflection.  In fact, the cleric pointed out that the demon was responsible for Maya's solitude and self-pity, and that the only one who was concerned about Maya's mixed breeding was Maya.

Maya scoffed at the cleric, told her that she did not know what she was talking about, turned and started to head back in the direction they came.  The cleric shouted back, which startled Maya, and declared that she understood more than Maya could ever know.  It was at that point that the elderly cleric revealed herself to be Maya's mother.  Maya again scoffed, stating that her mother died long ago.  The cleric bowed her head and replied that yes, she did die, but that she was granted the grace of Eilistaee to seek out Maya and aid her - aid her in destroying the demon of self-pity and solitude.  The cleric then went on to say that Maya would never find sanctuary by alienating herself from the company of others, but that sanctuary comes from within.  Once Maya could accept who she was, what she was, and the fact that there were many out in the world like her and who were willing to embrace her, then sanctuary would follow her, always.  Then, in a brief flash of light, the cleric was gone, leaving Maya to stew with the wisdom of the old cleric - her mother.

Maya thought on what her mother said, and soon tried to implement her mother's wisdom.  After a few months, Maya found her inner sanctuary, and became more powerful because of it.  In fact, that power was also absorbed by her splint mail armor.  All those who donned Maya's splint mail felt a peace flow through their being.  Each person found their own personal sanctuary within that armor, which soon became known as Sanctity of Being.

Aasimars are direct offspring from a union between mortal and celestial minion.  While normally carrying innate powers, it is not unusual for an Aasimar to don blessed armor.  Such is the case for this unique armor known as Aasimar's Aura.  The armor shimmers with a silvery glow and is adorned with exquisite blue etchings across the breast.  One look at the armor and it is simple to see that it possesses powerful protections.

Long ago, the Blood War between the Baazetu and the Tanar'ri spilled over to the material plane.  Luckily for most of the world, the battle was far away from any major towns or cities.  However, this was still no comfort for the Celestial beings that watched over the material plane.  So, it was quickly decided to amass as many Celestial and Aasimar beings as possible and drive the Blood War back into its own abyssal planes.  However, because of the great numbers of Tanar'ri and Baazetu, the Celestial beings permanently blessed all the Aasimars' armor with Protection from Evil.  This spell allowed the Aasimars to get in close to the evil creatures without getting attacked.  Once all the Aasimars were in position, the Celestials gave the order to attack, which completely surprised the hordes of Baazetu and Tanar'ri.  The ensuing battle raged for days, with high casualties on both sides, but eventually the evil hordes were pushed back into their abyssal planes.

As a result of the high Aasimar casualties, it was not uncommon for looters to take the armor off the dead.  So, from time to time, a set of Aasimar's Aura will pop up in a shop, or on an adventurer who could afford the high purchase price.

Plate and full plate are arguably the toughest armor in any realm.  However, no one can deny that full plate is susceptible to crushing damage.  In fact, most bludgeoning weapons were created with the intention of blowing through full plate armor.

With this thought in mind, the armor known as Diamond Cut was forged.  No one is exactly sure how Diamond Cut came into existence, but what is known is that the renowned Mirabar armorsmith, Cutter Boomstock, one day unveiled the armor to a well-to-do knight who traveled all the way from Amn.  Diamond Cut glistened in the firelight like a thousand diamonds, almost blinding was the intensity of the sheen.  And, in a remarkable demonstration, Cutter Boomstock lifted his anvil high in the air and struck the armor.  To everyone's amazement, the strike left no mark on the sparkling armor.

The knight happily took the armor and left Mirabar forever, never to be seen again.  However, his armor, Diamond Cut, has been seen from time to time, leading people to speculate that the elaborate knight met an untimely death.

@668    = ~Flank of the Virgin: +1 Large Shield

It is rare that the residents of the Ten-Towns willingly interfere in the affairs of the native barbarians.  Occasionally, the townsmen cannot help but come across a landmark or religious site that the barbarians erected.  Twenty years ago, Sammel Colger of Bremen was fishing near the Sea of Moving Ice when he discovered the remnants of a small barbarian ship.  He was drawn to a particular piece of the hull that had a colorful painting on the side.  As he pulled the wood from the water, a polar bear leapt up from the depths and struck at the young man's head.  Instinctively, he pulled the wood towards his face. The bear's huge talons were deflected.  Amazingly, the creature slipped and fell back into the cold water.  Not hesitating to see what the bear would do, Sammel rushed back to his small ship and returned to Bremen.  A priest of Tempus later told the young man that the painting was of a sacrificial virgin.  He believed that the small boat must have drifted all the way from Maer Dualdon to the Sea of Moving Ice, where it was smashed to pieces.  Sammel had the wood fashioned into a shield, which he took with him on his far-reaching fishing trips until the end of his days.

Myo-Myo was a famous ghost hunter from T'u Lung in Kara Tur, and made her living by slaying or banishing all manner of demons and foul spirits.

@672    = ~Red Fang's Tomb: +3 Tower Shield

This red iron tower shield reaches nearly from the chin to the toe of the user.  It is heavy even for a shield of its size, much of the weight coming from a large sculpted dragon's head set into its face - the head, wrought in the same red metal as the rest of the shield, protrudes almost like a gargoyle from a castle wall.

The head is the likeness of Red Fang, one-time mount of a tyrannical warrior-king from a land long ago forgotten.  When Red Fang was slain in battle, the warrior-king had the beast's soul bound to this shield so that the faithful dragon could still accompany him into battle.  Once per day Red Fang's iron head can breathe a gout of searing flame at the shield-bearer's command.

The warrior-king was eventually slain himself by a trio of brave heroes.  Though his shield has been sighted numerous times throughout the realms, his great horned helm and mighty golden axe have yet to be rediscovered.

What is known for certain is that the murderous woman is long gone and her belongings have been found scattered here and there throughout the realms ever since.

Forged of dull black steel, the blade is engraved in the fashion of a barbed tongue while the handle is textured with minute scales.  Because the enchanted dagger whips back to the thrower's hand once it has struck a solid object, its barbs can do horrendous damage to a target.  Many a bravo were felled by Black Lamia's Tongue before coming within ten paces of her, their last breaths escaping through a burbling, crimson hole in their throats.

// Arc of Gold
@718    = ~Arc of Gold: +4 Composite Longbow

It can be argued that the Arc of Gold and its sister, the Mithral Arc, brought about the end of the dwarven-elvish alliance in the North many years past, and led to the destruction of the Severed Hand and the fall of Dorn's Deep.  Many tragedies have occurred around these two items, and many are the deaths they caused although no arrow was ever shot from them.

At the height of the dwarven-elvish alliance in the North, a disagreement arose between the two races over the matter of trading enchanted weapons to the men of the south, who were beginning to establish a foothold in the North.  The dwarves were of the opinion that the many great works that had been built through the joint efforts of the dwarves and elves should be offered up to man and the profits used to fill the coffers of both races.  This suggestion was not well-received by the elves nor by their leader, the arch-mage Larrel, and the matter was quickly dropped.

However, when the Arc of Gold, one of the items fashioned jointly by dwarven and elven weaponsmiths was found in the hands of an orcish war party not long after the debate in the alliance councils, the elves accused the dwarves of selling the weapons to the goblinoids out of greed.  The dwarves, insulted, broke the shafts of their hammers in the middle of the council and broke talks with the elves, returning to their halls in Dorn's Deep and never speaking to them again. The two races, now divided, were soon swallowed by the Dark Horde that was devouring the North beneath its banner.

At the time of the fall of the Severed Hand, the Arc of Gold was mounted within the halls of Severed Hand as a reminder of the dwarven treachery and dwarven greed.  When the Severed Hand fell, the Arc of Gold silently watched as the goblinoids tore apart the elvish defenders and laid waste to tower after tower, until the elvish archmage Larrel, in a desperate measure, brought about the Mythal cataclysm that sealed the fate of the Severed Hand once and for all.

When the Mythal was cast, the Arc of Gold vanished from the halls of the Severed Hand and has not been seen since... until now.

// Mithril Arc
@719    = ~Mithril Arc: +5 Composite Longbow

It can be argued that the Mithral Arc and its brother, the Arc of Gold, brought about the end of the dwarven-elvish alliance in the North many years past, and led to the destruction of the Severed Hand and the fall of Dorn's Deep.  Many tragedies have occurred around these two items, and many are the deaths they caused although no arrow was ever shot from them.

The Mithral Arc was developed at the height of the dwarven-elvish alliance, and it was one of the many joint items developed by the dwarves and elves of the Severed Hand before the destruction of the Severed Hand and the Fall of Dorn's Deep.  Its accuracy was unparalleled, and the dwarves presented it to the elves as a token of goodwill between the races. The string of the bow was said to have been blessed by the elvish archmage Larrel himself, with a range that seemed to rival the horizon.  It was mounted in the halls of Severed Hand so that all visitors could see it, and see the achievements the dwarves and elves united could bring about.

When its brother, the Arc of Gold, was discovered in the hands of a band of orcs raiding in the forests north of Severed Hand, the elves became furious and accused the dwarves of selling the relics the two races had jointly crafted to their enemies.  The dwarves, enraged by the insult, seized the Mithral Arc and returned to Dorn's Deep, cutting off all contact with the elves.

It is said that at the moment the alliance disbanded, the string of the Mithral Arc broke with a final twang, and the bow, useless, remained deep within Lower Dorn's Deep, silently watching as the dwarves were slowly driven deeper and deeper into the Deep by the encroaching goblinoid hordes that had begun to swarm down from the North.  It was never seen and never taken by the Dark Horde that marched through Dorn's Deep, and the Mithral Arc remained there for countless years in the darkness with the dwarven dead piled around it, still clutching their weapons.

How it came to be here is unknown, but the string of the Mithral Arc is restored and the bow is eager to be used.  Perhaps there is hope for the fallen elves and dwarves still... or at least the opportunity to reclaim their once-proud homeland from the goblin hordes that threaten it.

The druids eventually killed the persistent ranger, but only at the cost of several druids' lives.

Though the elves will neither confirm nor deny the legend, some human tales state that keen-eyed Bariah never missed a target in battle.  His bow, crafted by his mother, was never given a name that was known outside of the family.  The humans that suffered under its power called it "Sun-Reacher," believing that Bariah's arrows could reach into the heavens themselves.  In a battle that many Evereskans are bitter about to this day, Bariah's griffon mount was killed in the sky by the spells of invisible wizards that ambushed an elven patrol.  Though only one mage escaped with his life, he did manage to take Sun-Reacher with him.

Over time, Arioth became a great hero and champion for the innocents of Cormyr and the Dalelands, though he shied away from such praise.  His worn, heavy crossbow was named after his dead wife, Geloise.

// Beloved Geloise
@733    = ~Beloved Geloise: +5 Heavy Crossbow

A human adventurer from the Dalelands named Arioth Cooper used this heavy crossbow on many of his journeys.  Arioth had lived in a small community near the edge of Anauroch, the great desert.  When a mysterious force emerged from the sands to destroy the village, Arioth's wife was killed.  Through circumstance, Arioth became a wandering mercenary.  Over time, Arioth became a great hero and champion for the innocents of Cormyr and the Dalelands, though he shied away from such praise.  His worn, heavy crossbow was named after his dead wife, Geloise.  When Arioth died of old age, his wishes were that his equipment be sold off at an auction in Essembra, Battledale, and the proceeds given to the citizens of that village.

// Mailripper
@734    = ~Mailripper: +1 Heavy Crossbow

An arbalest of dwarven manufacture, Mailripper has been seen in use across Icewind Dale for at least a hundred years.  On the rare occasions that groups of dwarves appear on the tundra, they are typically gathered for battle.   The leader of the Warcrest clan always kept a keen-eyed warrior armed with Mailripper by his side.  The warrior's instructions were simple: shoot the most heavily armored opponent you see approaching the king.

When the Warcrest clan was wiped out in a woeful conflict with barbarians, some warriors from Bryn Shander used it for idle target practice before they died en route to Redwaters.

// Iron Mary's Reply
@736    = ~Iron Mary's Reply: +3 Light Crossbow of Accuracy

"Iron" Mary of Tantras was a woman of stunning beauty and deadly serious resolve.  Iron Mary was easily spotted among her dark-haired mercenary company. Not deigning to wear a helmet, she knew her long blonde hair was visible from across a battlefield.  Mary was often hired to track down groups of criminals in lawless lands and put an end to their activities.  After five years, troublemakers throughout the Moonsea and Inner Sea knew that if Iron Mary was on their heels, they had angered someone of considerable importance.  Instead of putting up a proper fight, many outlaws would attempt to surrender.  Iron Mary never accepted surrender, so her reply was always a crossbow bolt shot into the forehead of the fool who dared to try talking his or her way out of impending doom.

This weapon is not named for its user, but rather the person against whom it was used.  Makavail was a scheming, lying, manipulative cheat who operated near the city of Westgate on the Lake of Dragons.  Among the many enemies he made was a soldier from Teziir named Ricarl of the Mark.  Ricarl wanted to get Makavail in trouble without letting his target know it was he who was responsible.  When Makavail was exiting Westgate with chests full of stolen goods, Ricarl shot the leg of one of the horses pulling Makavail's wagon.  The horse bolted and overturned the wagon.  Guards rushed to the scene and discovered what Makavail was up to.  He was thrown in prison and died only a year later.  He never knew who had fired the fateful bolt that caused his downfall.

@763    = ~This longbow is the subject of legend among the squabbling citadels of the Sword Coast, a legend fiercely debated in drinking halls and taverns in and along the storm-lashed coast.  According to the tale, the bow takes its name from its pivotal role in the escape of a young woman named Sophia, a typical maiden fair who was pledged to marry the son of Duke Hugh Gladegrin (the son is described as hideously ugly and of foul temperament, of course).  Sophia, however, believed she was destined to marry one of the Duke's archers, a dashing young golden-haired fellow who roamed the surrounding lands felling foul beasts with a single twang of his mighty bow.  As the tale goes, one of the court wizards (a transmuter) took pity on the young woman's plight and cast a spell that turned her into an arrow for an hour's time.  The transmuter arranged for Sophia to be fired from the castle wall to a ship waiting off the coast, where she could sail to freedom.

The tale then breaks down from here, as numerous accounts claim that Sophia did not flee the coast safely, and that she transformed back into her normal body while she was halfway across the water, plunging into the icy ocean.  Another school claims that, while in arrow form, Sophia pierced the side of the ship, then choked to death when she resumed her normal form with her neck embedded in the ship's hull.  Still others claim that she was never even launched from the bow, and that she resumed her normal form while inside the archer's quiver, and she awoke, naked, wearing only the small band of leather about her body. When this last argument is made, the discussion generally deteriorates into a steady stream of sexual innuendos and the evening officially goes downhill. 

Whatever the tale, the bow has a range unmatched by many other bows in the realms, and the arrows launched from it strike far and true - unlike the story surrounding the bow.

This magnificent composite shortbow has a history that is both heroic and yet mysterious.  Many are the tales of the strange human barbarian, Karthag, and his bow, named Arpathia, apparantly after the land from whence he came.  However, none know of such a land and it has long been assumed by the most learned masters of lore that Karthag may have come from some other dimension, although there is no way to prove this assumption.

Not the largest or strongest of warrior, Karthag was most at home on the back of a horse with Arpathia in hand.  When fighting with his magnificent bow Arpathia, Karthag was incredibly difficult to strike in battle, whether with weapons or magic.

What is clear to the skilled eyes of archer and bowyer alike is that Arpathia is a magnificently constructed composite shortbow.  Lesser eyes may look at this rugged shortbow and think that it cannot match the power and elegance of a good longbow.And while it is true that it does not match the beauty of many finely-crafted elven longbows, Arpathia's true beauty is in its performance.  In the hands of a strong-armed, skilled archer, Arpathia is as fine a horsebow as can be imagined.

Before Ilban, however, Valiant was in the possession of a holy slayer from distant Zakhara.  According to sages, the light sword was crafted to serve an order of assassins.  Valiant's owners survived through many incredible ordeals, mostly because of the magic of the weapon.  The weapon was lost in Calimshan when a holy slayer pursued a pasha's blasphemous agents to Calimport.  The scimitar remained in the hands of Baris Cabal for about a dozen years before the band was broken up by Ilban and his companions.  Ilban's exploits took Valiant into battle against sandmen, giant scorpions, desert raiders, evil sorcerers and the demonic servants of Celan Harad.

The weapon was lost in Calimshan when a holy slayer pursued a pasha's blasphemous agents to Calimport.  The scimitar remained in the hands of Baris Cabal for about a dozen years before the band was broken up by Ilban and his companions.  Ilban's exploits took the Valiant Blade into battle against sandmen, giant scorpions, desert raiders, evil sorcerers and the demonic servants of Celan Harad.

This massive two-handed woodsman's axe once belonged to verbeeg named Magar.  Magar was actually a rather decent sort, as verbeegs go.  For many years, he worked with a number of human and dwarven woodsmen, calling most of them friend until one day when they were ambushed by a large group of angry treants.  All of Magar's friends were slain before he could stop the treants.  Angered byond endurance, Magar cut down every last treant with his mighty axe. After the battle, Magar, inconsolable over the loss of his friends, swore that he would chop down every last tree in the forest in the vain hope of slaying every treant he could find. 

However, Magar was never able to fulfill his oath.  Having heard of the verbeeg's attempt to destroy the forest, a group of shadow druids sought out Magar to defend the forest from his vengeance.  Although the shadow druids were able to surprise Magar, his trusty axe prevented the druids from entangling him as Magar charged into their ranks.  While Magar slew at least a half dozen of the druids, their numbers were simply too great for even the mighty Magar to overcome.

For many years, Magar's Axe was presumed lost to the woods, or perhaps hidden by the shadow druids, until it turned up in Neverwinter.
