A. What is it?

The Light of Selûne (LOS) is a mod for Icewind Dale 2.

LOS adds a considerable number of new items, updated items, some converted IWD1 
items, some class updates (particularly the Ranger class), nastier traps, and 
4 new merchants.




B. Installation Instructions

Obviously, IWD2 is required. 

Unzip the ZIP file into your IWD2 folder. Normally, this is should be:

        C:\Program Files\Black Isle\Icewind Dale II\

Run (i.e. click on) "Setup-LOS.exe". 

LOS can be uninstalled by re-running "Setup-LOS.exe". 

For the most part, you do not need to start a new game to take advantage 
of the mod.  However, any area or merchant that you have already visited 
will not be updated with any new items.  For the best experience, I suggest 
starting a new game, since there are additions right in Targos itself.



C. Features


New Items

Light of Selûne adds a large number of new items to both Normal and Heart of 
Fury modes. These new items are spread across a variety of enchantment levels 
and item types.


Iwd1 Items

Light of Selûne adds a few items that were converted from Icewind Dale 1. These 
items were, in most cases, converted faithfully, but in some other cases, I must 
admit to a small bit of creative license.


New Stores

Light of Selûne adds a number of new stores spread throughout the game where your 
party can purchase a wide variety of new and current items. Among these stores are 
two general merchants in Targos, a Bowyer in the Wandering Village, and a small 
arcane merchant in Kuldahar. (You will have to look hard for the arcane merchant. 
He's hiding from all those nasty Yuan-ti.)


Updated Classes

Light of Selûne updates the Ranger and Bard (less so) classes in IWD2 to be closer 
to the 3.5 edition rules, as presented in the Player's Handbook. (Please do not 
expect this updating to be complete and all-encompassing. There are limitations to 
what can be done within IE.  These are minor tweaks, little more.)

Rev2 Note: Some of the tweaks in this section have been removed, such as the buggy
Ranger Reflex Save tweak, and the unpopular Sorcerer 2 SP Diplomacy cost.  Furthermore,
I've made some tweaks to try to improve the combat capability of some of the classes 
in ways that aren't legal by normal D&D rules.  I've done this because the value of 
those classes according to the p&p D&D rules doesn't always translate into the hack
and slash nature of IWD2, and the only real ways to improve some underpowered classes
is to improve their combat power in non-standard ways.

Also, I've updated the cost of talking skills for ALL classes to be be equal to 1,
with very few exceptions.  The reasons for this are two fold.  First, conceptually,
this has bugged me that these skills were so linked to class in the first place.
And second, allowing all classes to have nearly universal access to the talking
skills as in-class 1 SP skills should allow players to consider letting other
characters speak for their party beyond the "usual suspects" (i.e. sorcerers, 
bards, or paladins).




Updated Existing Items

Another feature of the Light of Selûne are a number of modifications to existing 
IWD2 items.  Sometimes this was done to fix some perceived error or bug. Sometimes 
this was done to weaken weapons that I believed were overpowered or to upgrade 
underpowered ones. Sometimes I replaced an existing item with a considerably different 
item, simply because the existing item didn't make sense to me in the hands of the 
monster that possessed it. And sometimes I simply moved underpowered items earlier 
in the game to a point where it would no longer be underpowered.

Also note that I put in considerable effort to upgrade nearly all of the original 
armors and shields to make them into "good" items that were worthy of their location 
in the game.

Another group of items that I updated was bows. IWD2 improperly handles bows in the 
official game. Longbows are supposed to do 1d8 damage, while shortbows do only 1d6. 
This meant that all longbows, composite and non-composite needed to get an additional 
+2 bonus to damage.

Furthermore, all of the various bows in IWD2 did not have any Strength prerequisites. 
Of course, hardly any items had enforced strength pre-reqs, but that's another matter. 
I updated all bows, except non-composite shortbows, in the game to have enforced strength 
pre-reqs. In general, the following table lists the modded Strength prerequisites for 
most bows.

    Composite Longbows: STR 14 required
    Regular Longbows: STR 10 required
    Composite Shortbows: STR 12 required

However, there are some specific bows, including a couple of "official" bows, that 
have prerequisites that are higher than standard. These particular bows do additional 
damage above the norm for that type of bow and enchantment level, due to the greater 
pull of the bowstring.


Updated Traps
-------------

Light of Selûne considerably updates most of the traps in the game. Do NOT take them 
for granted. Disarm them or else. "Or else what?", you ask. Paaaaaaaain. 

Initial release note: While the traps are a bit tougher and annoying at times, they 
are not nearly as "nasty" as I intended. I already have plans to further improve the 
"nastiness" of the traps in the next revision, including HOF versions of the traps 
that will make the HOF versions much, much nastier so that you cannot just walk thru 
them and suck up a few HP of damage with your 200-300 HP tank.

LOS Rev2 Traps Note: I've increased the power of traps by 50% for rev2.




Some Small Racial Modifications
-------------------------------

Rock Gnomes and all Halflings get a +1 bonus to AC (functionally provided by giving them the Dodge feat)






More Details about the minor class updates

Druids
------
Druids cannot wear metal armor of any kind. This does not apply to armors made of 
natural materials, such as leather, hide, or shells. (Do not despair, druid-lovers. 
There are plenty of new armors for druids to wear. And the ol' beetle armors are 
still usable by druids.)

Tracking: Druids get the Forester feat free at creation.
Additional spells: Druids now get the following spells:
    Protection from Evil @ L1
    Bull's Strength, Cat's Grace @ L2
    Magic Circle against Evil @ L3
    Stoneskin @ L5
    Tremor; move from L9 to L8


Bards
-----
Bards now only start with Light Armor proficiency.
Bards get the Martial Weapon: Bow proficiency.
Bards now get 3 skill points per level.


Paladins
--------
Additional spells: Paladins can now cast the following spells:
    Eagle's Splendor @ L2
    Remove Curse @ L3
Get additional bonus feats every 4th level, starting at level 4.

Rangers
-------
Rangers are now a 1d8 hit points per level class.  (REMOVED in Rev2 to provide a slight enhancement to the class.)
Rangers now get an improved Reflex Save progression. (REMOVED in Rev2 since it proved buggy in multiclassing situations.)
Rangers now only start with Light Armor proficiency.
Rangers now get 3 skill points per level.
Tracking: Rangers get the Forester feat free at creation.
Archery: Rangers get +1 missile AB and +1 missile damage every 3rd level, starting at level 3. (REMOVED in Rev 2... wasn't working properly.)
Additional spells: Rangers can now cast the following spells:
    Charm Animal or Person @ L1
    Barkskin, Bull's Strength, Cat's Grace, Spike Growth @ L2
Get additional bonus feats every 4th level, starting at level 4.
Rangers now get the Lightning Reflexes feat free at creation as a mild replacement for removing
    the (buggy) improved Reflex Save progression update.


Rogues
------
Get 2 additional bonus feats, 1 at level 4, and one at level 7.


Update Feats
------------

I've updated the benefits of all Weapon Focus and Specialization feats thusly.
Weapon Focus now provides a +1 to-hit and +2 damage bonus, and Weapon Specialization
provides a +2 to-hit and +4 damage bonus.



Rev 2 Changes
-------------

* Removed Ranger 1d8 HP, returning to the standard 1d10.  
    (Reason: no sense in weakening an already weak class.)
    
* Removed the Ranger improved Reflex save progression. 
    (Reason: The Reflex save was buggy in multiclass situations.)
    
* Added a free Lightning Reflexes feat for Rangers at creation. 
   (Reason: this is a mild replacement for the removal of the buggy "improved" Relflex save progression.)

* Removed the Ranger +1 missile AB and damage bonus every 3rd level.  
   (Reason: it wasn't working properly, or at least not visibly so.)

* Added bonus feats for Rangers and Paladins every 4th level starting at level 4.
   (Reason: to "improve" two seemingly weak classes.)

* Added 2 additional bonus feats for Rogues at levels 4 and 7.
   (Reason: to "improve" a seemingly weak rogue class.)

* Changed cost of the Alchemy skill for Rogues to 1 point.
   (Reason: to make the rather weak Envenom Weapon rogue feat more attainable in normal mode.)

* Increased damage produced by traps by 50%.
   (Reason: to "improve" a seemingly weak rogue class by increasing the danger posed by traps.)

* Added a +1 AC "size" bonus for Rock Gnomes (but not Deep Gnomes) and all Halflings.
   This bonus is implemented as giving the Dodge feat free for for these races, regardless of DEX.
 
* Changed Weapon Focus and Specialization to +1 AB/+2 damage for Focus, and +2 AB/+4 damage for Specialization.
   (Reason: to strengthen the weapon feats to make them more worthwhile.)

* All talking skills have been changed to in-class 1 point skills for all classes. 
   (Reason: to make it more possible for classes other than the high CHA paladin, sorcerer, or bard
   classes to be decent party spokesmen.)
